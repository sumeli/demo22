      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am Sumeli Debdas, a student of University of Engineering and Managment. I am creating
          this page in order to share some helpful facts about dogs. This is a personal page and
          whatever I am going to write will be from my personal knowledge. So, pardon my mistakes
          if there are any.

      <h3>What to do :</h3>
        <table cellspacing="50">
        
        <td>
        <p>
             1. <b>Take small steps : </b> First you need to have a clear idea about the type
          of behaviour that you want from your dog and then start teaching him/her. Generally
          dogs enjoy their training sessions and love them when they recieve a reward for that.
          For example, you can give treats to your dog as a reward after a succesfull training.
          Also, if your dog is not getting what you are asking of him/her, then start giving 
          him/her rewards for small steps.
            <br><br>
            2. <b>Try to be consistent : </b> Detailed training are generally good for dogs. For example,
            "Sit down", "Stand up", "Lay down", these are all different cues for your dog. So, it will be better
            if you use exactly the same command for a particular behaviour. This will help your dog to 
            understand what you are asking. 
            <br><br>
            3. <b>Show positivity towards them : </b> Whenever they will do something that you asked
            for succesfully, give them cuddles and pet them, give them treats. This will make them 
            happy and they will try to obey your words next time to get those rewards again. 
            <br><br>
            4. <b>Do seek help from professionals if needed : </b> Dogs may sometimes show some complex
            behaviours which can only be solved by a professional. At those times, do take them to some 
            expert or else it may get worse.

          <td>
        <p>
    
            1. <b>DO NOT give them toxic foods : </b> Whenever you are getting a dog, make sure 
            that you know all kinds of foods you will be providing to your dog. Do not give 
            them anything toxic or which are not good for dogs. Do not give them extra food, 
            they should be served with a proper amount of food everyday.
            <br><br>
            2. <b>DO NOT treat them in a violent way : </b> If your dog is not getting what you
            are asking then DO NOT beat them or yell at them. Try to make him/her understand. If needed,
            try another day, but DO NOT scold them. This can either make them ferocious or can shut them down
            completely.
            <br><br>
            3. <b>DO NOT have a long training session : </b> Most of the dogs can do best till 10 to 15 minutes.
            So, DO NOT have your training sessions go longer than 20 minutes. Even five minutes of 
            training can be very effective, especially if you are able to do it multiple times per 
            day.
